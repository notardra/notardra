- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @notardra
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a complete beginner to coding and have no prior baground. I started creating projects to learn more and because it was interesting.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python.
- ğŸ“« My instagram is @ardraa_
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can recite the alphabets backwards and in the QWERTY order. I also learnt morse code, so that I could write my diary in peace.
- By the end of the year I hope to create a currency converter website, and a chat app with real-time communication, with a front end and back end!
