- 👋 Hi, I’m @notardra
- 👀 I’m a complete beginner to coding and have no prior baground. I started creating projects to learn more and because it was interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and creating projects on blender
- 📫 My instagram is @ardraa
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can recite the alphabets backwards and in the QWERTY order. I also learnt morse code, so that I could write my diary in peace.
- By the end of the year I hope to create a currency converter website, and a chat app with real-time communication, with a front end and back end!
